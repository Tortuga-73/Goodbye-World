TITLE: Godbye World
BY: Seth Harrison

DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple endless wave-based zombie survival shooter in which the player attempts to live as long as possible against increasingly strong zombies. 
There is no condition for winning the game, as the goal is to see how long the player can make it before losing.
The player can acquire items and upgrades in exchange for points gained by killing zombies.

FEATURES:
*Multiple different weapons; 2 different classes: normal gun and shotgun.
  Normal: Single raycast/bullet, only one hit and one damage value.
  Shotgun: Multiple raycasts/pellets, multiple hits.
*Menu screen, level select, death screen and levels.
*Two different maps: Forest theme and City theme.
*Endless wave spawner system with different types and difficulties of zombies.
*Menu and level music.
*Animations for zombies and guns; sound effects for guns firing.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
*Unity game development engine
*Microsoft Visual Studio for script editing

INSTALLMENT & RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS | 
Two methods of installing:
1. Download the Unity project files and open with the Unity editor
2. WARNING - I have not been able to get the build files to properly upload to GitHub, so I am still working on solutions to get the build of the game uploaded. When it works, you will be able to download the Build folder and run the "Goodbye World.exe" file to run the game.

KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS: 
*The shotgun does not currently play the muzzle flash animation or audio, I am still looking into this issue.
*When killing a zombie with the shotgun, extra points may be awarded; likely due to multiple pellets registering at the same time.
*Stats are not saved between scenes, limiting the information displayed on the death screen.
*Zombie animations sometimes do not line up accurately with movement.

FUTURE IMPROVMENTS: 
*Add more variety in music; different tracks for each scene or multiple tracks throughout a level.
*Add more difficulty scaling for zombies; Ideally, add an infinitely scaleable stat multiplier system that would not reach a maximum difficulty.
*Add more weapon types for a variety of playstyles.
*Add more player upgrades than health and speed.
*Add more detailed graphics and animations.
